# Genetic 7 Wonders

My attempt at applying a genetic algorithm to play the board game, 7 Wonders.

## 7 Wonders

7 Wonders has a lot of rules and game mechanics, and I haven't coded it all up yet.

Missing
* side B of boards
* discount market cards
* buying resources from neighbors
* make age 2 pass cards counterclockwise
* add forward pointers for chaining cards (for the purpose of AI)
* compute victory points correctly for age 3 yellow cards
* the scattered TODOs throughout the codebase

## Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithm methodology is explained [here](http://ericlee123.github.io/2017/02/27/genetic-7-wonders-postmortem/).
